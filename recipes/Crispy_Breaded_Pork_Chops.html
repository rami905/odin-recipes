    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Description:</h2>
    <p>With a salty, flavorful crust and juicy, tender meat in the center, these crispy breaded pork chops remind me of my grandmother's… so simple, yet so delicious! The perfect comfort meal when served with mashed potatoes and green beans.</p>
    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>    
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>    
        <li>1 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>    
        <li>4 (5 ounce) bone-in, center-cut pork chops</li>    
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>    
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly coat a wire rack with cooking spray and set in a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs and water together in a shallow dish. Place bread crumbs in a second shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Season pork chops evenly with salt and pepper. Dip and coat chops in egg, allow excess to drip off, then dip in bread crumbs until well coated.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 2 chops in the skillet and cook until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until crisp on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to the prepared rack. Heat remaining oil in the skillet and repeat to sear remaining chops.</li>
        <li>Bake pork chops in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 155 degrees F (68 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
